This is a simple module to spin up 2 metal servers in 2 different metros and establish a fabric connection between them where one server uses a metal dedicated port and the other uses a metal shared port.

A sample terraform.tfvars and privatekey.pem file is provided, replace the .pem file with your private key and change the values in the .tfvars file and run the code.
